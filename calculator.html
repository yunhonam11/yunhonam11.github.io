        <h2> How to Use </h2>
        <p>
            <b>Device Height:</b> Fill the input with the height of your device from any flat surface to the bottom piece of the hinges. This must be done in inches.
            <br>
            <b>Distance:</b> Fill the input with the distance of your device from the object being measured. This must be done in inches.
            <br>
            <b>Angle of Elevation:</b> When you have your clinometers prepared and built as instructed, one will require you to calculate the angle of elevation,
            and the other will directly measure the angle of elevation. For both devices, the angle input will require you to enter the angle of 
            elevation.
